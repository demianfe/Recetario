[Description] QEMU is a fast processor emulator. Using dynamic
translation it achieves a reasonable  speed while being
easy to port to new host CPUs.  In its user mode
emulation mode, it can  launch Linux processes
compiled for one CPU on another CPU. Linux system
calls are converted because of endianness and 32/64
bit mismatches.  In its full system emulation mode, it
emulates a full system, including a processor and 
various peripherials.
