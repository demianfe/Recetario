# Recetario
Gobolinux recipes that are not pushed upstream, mostly work in progress.

# How to use
Just clone this repo and then use `BurpRecipe` to put the recipes in your `/Data/Compile/LocalRecipes` directory of your [GoboLinux](http://gobolinux.org/), 
like this for example (Replace `[RECIPE_NAME]` with the name of the recipe you want to compile):

```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/demianfe/Recetario.git
~$ ./BurpRecipe Recetario/[RECIPE_NAME]
```

*Good Luck, Have Fun*
