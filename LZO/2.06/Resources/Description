[Description] LZO is a portable lossless data compression
library written in ANSI C. It offers pretty fast
compression and very fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory. In addition
there are slower compression levels achieving a
quite competitive compression ratio while still
decompressing at this very high speed.
