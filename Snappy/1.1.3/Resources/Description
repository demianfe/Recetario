[Name] Snappy
[Summary] Snappy is a compression/decompression library
[Description] Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum \
  compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, \
  it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, \
  compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster \
  for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to \
  100% bigger. \
  Snappy has the following properties: \
  * Fast: Compression speeds at 250 MB/sec and beyond, with no assembler code. \
  * Stable: Over the last few years, Snappy has compressed and decompressed \
    petabytes of data in Google's production environment. The Snappy bitstream \
    format is stable and will not change between versions. \
  * Robust: The Snappy decompressor is designed not to crash in the face of \
    corrupted or malicious input. \
  Snappy has previously been called "Zippy" in some Google presentations and the like.
