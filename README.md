# Recetario
Gobolinux recipes that are not pushed upstream, mostly work in progress.

# How to use
- Just clone this repo and then use `GetRecipe` to put the recipes in your `/Data/Recipes` directory of your [GoboLinux](http://gobolinux.org/), 
like this for example (Replace `[RECIPE_NAME]` with the name of the recipe you want to compile):

```bash
~$ clone https://github.com/demianfe/Recipes.git
~$ GetRecipe Recipes/[RECIPE_NAME]
```
